# Algebra Calculator

This is a simple Python project that serves as an **Algebra Calculator**. It can solve linear and quadratic equations, simplify algebraic expressions, and expand algebraic expressions using the **SymPy** library.

## Features

1. **Linear Equation Solver**: Solves equations of the form `ax + b = 0`.
2. **Quadratic Equation Solver**: Solves quadratic equations of the form `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`.
3. **Simplify Algebraic Expressions**: Simplifies expressions like `x^2 + 2*x + 1`.
4. **Expand Algebraic Expressions**: Expands expressions like `(x + 1)^2`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/) library

Install the SymPy library using pip:

```bash
pip install sympy
